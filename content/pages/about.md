I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Sotheby's. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at a startup and before that, I studied Statistics and Computer Science at Duke. My interests include Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and engineering. The goal of this blog is synthesize new information I learn, and posts may include summaries/implementations of papers or discussions of production ML systems.
